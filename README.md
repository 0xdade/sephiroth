# Sephiroth

A Python3 script to build cloud block lists for servers.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+ (Sephiroth makes use of f-strings)

## Setup

It is recommended to install the requirements into a virtual environment. From a brand new Ubuntu 18.04 machine, the setup flow should look something like this:

```
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-venv git
$ git clone https://github.com/0xdade/sephiroth.git
$ cd sephiroth/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Sephiroth provides a built in help menu through the use of Python's argparse library. It tells you which commands are required, as well as other options.

```
dade/Desktop/sephiroth via sephiroth
âžœ python sephiroth.py --help
usage: Sephiroth [-h] -s {nginx} -c {aws} [-p] [--no-ipv6] [-V]

Sephiroth is made to help block clouds.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {nginx}, --server {nginx}
                        Type of server to build blocklist for
  -c {aws}, --cloud {aws}
                        Cloud provider to block
  -p, --proxy           Using PROXY Protocol?
  --no-ipv6             Exclude ipv6 addresses from the block list where
                        applicable
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

## Supported Cloud Providers

* Amazon Web Services - `aws`
