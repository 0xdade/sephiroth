# Sephiroth

A Python3 script to build cloud block lists for servers.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+ (Sephiroth makes use of f-strings)

## Setup

It is recommended to install the requirements into a virtual environment. From a brand new Ubuntu 18.04 machine, the setup flow should look something like this:

```
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-venv git
$ git clone https://github.com/0xdade/sephiroth.git
$ cd sephiroth/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Sephiroth provides a built in help menu through the use of Python's argparse library. It tells you which commands are required, as well as other options.

```
sephiroth on ÓÇ† master [!?] on üê≥ v19.03.8 via sephiroth
‚ûú python sephiroth.py --help
usage: Sephiroth [-h] -s {nginx,apache,iptables,ip6tables} -t
                 {aws,azure,gcp,asn,file} [-a ASN] [-f FILENAME]
                 [-r REDIR_TARGET] [-p] [--no-ipv6] [-V]

Sephiroth is made to help block clouds.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {nginx,apache,iptables,ip6tables}, --server {nginx,apache,iptables,ip6tables}
                        Type of server to build blocklist for
  -t {aws,azure,gcp,asn,file}, --target {aws,azure,gcp,asn,file}
                        Targets to block
  -a ASN, --asn ASN     ASN to block in AS#### format
  -f FILENAME, --file FILENAME
                        Files to block addresses from
  -r REDIR_TARGET, --redir REDIR_TARGET
                        Place to redirect requests to. (apache)
  -p, --proxy           Using PROXY Protocol? (nginx)
  --no-ipv6             Exclude ipv6 addresses from the block list where
                        applicable
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

## Example

```
sephiroth on ÓÇ† master [!?] on üê≥ v19.03.8 via sephiroth took 7s
‚ûú python sephiroth.py -s nginx -t asn -a AS15169 -a AS31337 -t aws
(asn) Fetching IP ranges from api.hackertarget.com for 2 ASNs
(aws) Fetching IP ranges from Amazon
Your nginx blocklist for asn, aws can be found at output/2020-06-07_002847_nginx_asn_aws.conf

Please add this line to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf before the Virtual Host Configs.

        include /mnt/c/Users/dade/Desktop/sephiroth/output/2020-06-07_002847_nginx_asn_aws.conf;

Then you can use the $block_ip variable in your site config like so:

        if ($block_ip) {
                return 302 https://example.com;
        }

```


## Supported Servers

* `nginx` - Makes use of nginx's "ngx_http_geo_module" which comes with the nginx package in Ubuntu 18.04. Optionally supports the use of `proxy_protocol`, in the event that you are using a PROXY-enabled redirector.
* `apache` - Generates a mod_rewrite rule set to do conditional redirects based on cloud ip ranges. Does not (to my knowledge) support `proxy_protocol` usage. Requires `-r REDIR_TARGET` for the RewriteRule
* `iptables` - Generates a set of iptables DROP rules to block access from listed IPv4 ranges.
* `ip6tables` - Generates a set of ip6tables DROP rules to block access from listed IPv6 ranges.

## Supported Cloud Providers

* `aws` - Amazon Web Services. Obtained via the [documented download process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html#aws-ip-download).
* `azure` - Azure Cloud. Fetched via a two part process. Fetch the html of [the download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=56519) and then parse the html to get the `failoverLink` anchor tag. That JSON is then downloaded.
* `gcp` - Google Cloud Platform. Fetched via the absolutely insane abuse of spf records as outlined in the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/faq#find_ip_range).
* `oci` - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Fetched via the [documented download process](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/addressranges.htm) - KNOWN BUG SEE [#11](https://github.com/0xdade/sephiroth/issues/11)
* `asn` - Lookup IP ranges by ASN. Uses [Hackertarget](https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/) API to make fetching results painless. Limited to 100 ASN lookups per day per source IP.
* `file` - Read line-separated list of addresses from one or more files. Lines that begin with # are ignored and lines that contain a # after the address save the comment into the output.
