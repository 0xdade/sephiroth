**Do you have any examples of what this format looks like?**

<MySuperLeetWebServer uses a format where each ip range is only referenceable via it's integer definition, it doesn't understand quad-dotted.>

**Are there any other special capabilities required for this format to be useful?**

<E.g. nginx requires http_geo_module, apache requires mod_rewrite, MySuperLeetWebServer requires a python interface that gets dynamically loaded by the server and acts as a filter via the main() function.>
