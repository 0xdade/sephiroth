You can tell iptables to use these rules with iptables-restore:

    ip6tables-restore --noflush < {{ abspath }}

WARNING: If you do not include --noflush, you are very likely to lock yourself out of your system.

Once you've added these rules and tested them, save your new complete set of rules with ip6tables-save:

    ip6tables-save > /etc/ip6tables.rules
